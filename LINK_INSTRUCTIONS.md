Just run all the code inside a enviorment with the thinkdsp in the librarty of the assets and the code. 

This is the official link:

once that is open, you will see an error like this one 

Cannot GET /vMBxTlyvUcM5DXb37Upsye6EhaJPW4z7oTLHiHdIrBJcLsAIkbpg8LFmKA6qdMB0/

from the url, just erase all of this line and it will redirect to the lab, it should look like this
